To participate professionally in tennis or to become a licensed tennis player or coach, the key licensing and certification requirements involve:

- **Player Licenses**: Players often need a national or international player license to compete in official tournaments. For example, to enter ITF tournaments, players must obtain an ITF Player Identification Number (IPIN) with a professional membership costing around $75 USD. National licenses (from national tennis associations) are typically required first to compete and get rankings locally before advancing to international events.[1][4]

- **Coaching Licenses**: Tennis coaches need certification from recognized organizations like the USPTA (United States Professional Tennis Association) or PTR (Professional Tennis Registry). This involves attending teacher academies, passing written and practical exams, and maintaining continuing education.[3][10]

- **Regulatory Rules**: Players and coaches must comply with regulations such as age eligibility, safety education, anti-doping programs, and privacy protections as set by organizations like WTA, ATP, and ITF.[5][7]

- **Additional Requirements**: Coaches may need background checks, first aid certifications, and participate in approved training workshops.[2]

In summary, "license tennis" typically refers to official player or coach certifications required to compete or teach professionally, issued by national or international tennis governing bodies. These licenses regulate participation, maintain standards, and protect the rights and safety of players and coaches.
