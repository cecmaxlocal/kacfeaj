Licensing requirements for safes, particularly for companies or individuals dealing with secure storage and protection of valuables (like cash, documents, or sensitive items), generally fall under security licensing regulations related to:

- **Security Guard Licenses**: If operating safes as part of security services (e.g., cash-in-transit, guarded access), personnel often need security guard licenses, such as the UK's SIA license or equivalent licenses in other countries. These require training, background checks, and passing exams on handling valuables securely.[1][2][4]

- **Specialized Certifications**: In some jurisdictions, handling or servicing safes with biometric or electronic locking mechanisms may require specific technical certifications or licenses to ensure compliance with security standards.[2]

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Companies installing, maintaining, or managing safes must comply with local laws on security equipment and services, including licensing from state or national security authorities.

- **Age and Background Checks**: Applicants usually must be minimum age (e.g., 18 years), have no criminal record, and be of sound mind to qualify for licenses related to safe security.

In summary, while there is no universal "safe license," personnel and businesses involved in operating, guarding, or servicing safes often must obtain appropriate security or professional licenses mandated by local regulatory bodies, including training and certification to ensure safety and compliance.[3][4][1]
