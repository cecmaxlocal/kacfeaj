Regarding the license for "Cows" (assuming related to Cow4Mac or Cow4Math IDE), there is no publicly specific well-known license officially documented for that product based on available online sources. However, for typical software projects like an IDE or math tool suite, licenses often used include:

- Open source licenses (MIT, GPL, Apache) if the software aims to be community-driven and freely redistributable.
- Proprietary licenses with usage restrictions if the software is commercial or closed-source.

If you mean "Cow4Math" or related IDE projects you are developing or researching, it is recommended to define the license clearly in your project documentation or README, specifying:
- Whether it is open source or proprietary
- Usage rights and restrictions
- Warranty disclaimers
- Redistribution conditions

If you want to choose a license for your own project, popular choices for developer-friendly open source are the MIT License or Apache License 2.0 for permissive terms, or GPL for copyleft requirements.

If you meant something else by "license cows," please clarify.

For further details or license templates, sharing your project goals helps recommend the right license.
