Dell machines typically come with proprietary software licenses that govern the use of preinstalled software and drivers. Here are key points about licenses related to Dell computers:

- **Software License Type**: Dell software licenses may be perpetual, allowing use for as long as you comply with the terms, or term-based subscriptions requiring renewal.
- **Preinstalled Software**: Software preinstalled on Dell machines (including operating systems, drivers, utilities) is licensed under Dell’s End User License Agreements (EULAs), which restrict unauthorized copying, distribution, or modification.
- **Use Restrictions**: Dell licenses mandate using software only on the hardware it was intended for, prohibit transferring or sublicensing software without Dell’s permission, and forbid use of counterfeit versions.
- **Transferability**: For individual consumers, the software license may transfer with the hardware upon sale, provided you do not retain copies. For business customers, transfer requires Dell’s written consent.
- **Confidentiality and Compliance**: Users must treat Dell software as confidential and comply with license keys and usage instructions.

You can find specific license terms for your Dell machine’s software in its accompanying documentation or on Dell’s official website under license agreements. These licenses cover everything from BIOS and firmware to Dell utilities and optional software bundles.

In summary, Dell machines come with proprietary licenses that govern software usage strictly tied to the hardware, emphasizing compliance with usage terms and license transfer rules.[1][2][4][6]
