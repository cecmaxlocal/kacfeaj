Licensing requirements for fireworks vary by jurisdiction but generally include the following key aspects:

- **Retail and Wholesale Licenses**: To sell fireworks legally, most places require a retail or wholesale fireworks license, often issued by the state fire marshal or local authorities. This license ensures compliance with safety regulations and controls on fireworks distribution.[1][2]

- **Manufacturer and Distributor Licenses**: People or companies manufacturing or distributing fireworks need specific licenses that regulate the production, storage, transportation, and sale of pyrotechnic materials.[4][5]

- **Pyrotechnic Operator Licenses**: Individuals who assemble or conduct public fireworks displays usually require a special pyrotechnic operator’s license, which often includes passing tests, background checks, and documented experience assisting in displays.[4]

- **Local Permits and Regulations**: Fireworks licenses are often supplemented by local permits for retail stands or public displays. Site inspections and liability insurance proofs may be mandatory parts of the process.[3]

- **Safety and Compliance**: Compliance with explosive material regulations like those enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in the U.S. or respective national bodies is mandatory for manufacturers and distributors.[5]

- **Storage and Handling**: Special licensing and safety measures apply to storage of fireworks, including limits on amounts and secure facilities to minimize fire hazards.[7][10]

In summary, to legally sell, manufacture, store, or operate fireworks, multiple licenses and permits are generally required, each with strict safety, training, insurance, and operational requirements. These are regulated at state, local, and federal levels to protect public safety and ensure responsible use.[1][7][4]
