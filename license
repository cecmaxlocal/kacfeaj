Open source licenses allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared, promoting collaboration and transparency in software development. These licenses generally fall into two main categories:

### Copyleft Licenses
- Require derivative works to be distributed under the same license, ensuring that the source code (and modifications) remain free and open.
- Examples:
  - **GNU General Public License (GPL)**: Strong copyleft requiring distribution of source code for modified versions.
  - **Lesser GPL (LGPL)**: Allows linking with proprietary software under certain conditions.
  - **Mozilla Public License (MPL)**: A weaker copyleft license allowing combined works with proprietary code under file-level copyleft.

### Permissive Licenses
- Allow almost unrestricted reuse, modification, and redistribution, including incorporation into proprietary software.
- Examples:
  - **MIT License**: Simple and permissive; requires preservation of copyright notices but allows proprietary use.
  - **Apache License 2.0**: Includes explicit patent grants and requires attribution, also permits use in proprietary projects.
  - **BSD Licenses**: Similar to MIT with minimal restrictions.

### Choosing a License
- Use copyleft licenses if you want to ensure contributions and derivatives remain open source.
- Use permissive licenses if you prefer maximum freedom for users, including integration in closed-source software.
- Open Source Initiative (OSI) approves over 80 licenses but the above are the most widely used.

Open source licensing balances freedom for users with rights for creators and is essential for legal clarity and community trust in software projects.[1][3][4][5][6][7]
